This effort began as a way to get out of my graphic design head long enough to do a simple developer resume. I frequently needed a way to send a recruiter the link while away from a desktop. I wanted it to be clean, text searchable, and easy to iterate since I tend to change assignments or focus every couple of years.

The inital pipeline was using a Linux cli called Latex pdf.

Latex began having installation issus and was losing its dependencies. Overall too fussy to make a simple pdf.

I am switch to an npm tool
https://www.npmjs.com/package/md-to-pdf

This is installed globally and thus not shown here in the package.json.

### TODO

stylesheet integration  
html pipeline
